# Welcome to Team GOATS GitHub!
<h1 align="center"> Proud Developers of Svelte Toggles</h1>
<h3 align="center">We thank you for choosing our Toggles & hope you plan to stick with us!</h3> 

<p align="center"> We're a small group of Diploma Students from HolmesGlen Institute who chose to create something for the Development Community to use, and to help their development experience become a little easier! We're all relatively new to Svelte & using SVG's in this manner so bare with us :)</p>

<p align="center">Svelte Toggles is a library of Light & Dark mode Toggle Switches that have all the Local Storage jargon done for you, all you need is to create your own function to switch themes!</p>
